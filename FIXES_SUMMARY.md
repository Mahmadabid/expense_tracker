# Fixed Issues Summary

## âœ… All Issues Resolved!

---

## 1. âœ… **Fixed Number Input Scroll Behavior**

### Problem
When scrolling with mouse wheel over number inputs, the value would increment/decrement unintentionally.

### Solution
Added `onWheel={(e) => e.currentTarget.blur()}` to all number inputs:
- Payment amount input in LoanCard
- Transaction amount input in modal forms

### What This Does
When you scroll over a focused number input, it automatically blurs (unfocuses) the field, preventing accidental value changes.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/layout/MainContent.tsx` (2 locations)

---

## 2. âœ… **Changed Base Currency to PKR**

### Problem
Currency conversion API was using USD as base currency.

### Solution
Updated `BASE_CURRENCY` from `'USD'` to `'PKR'` in the currency conversion utility.

### Changes Made
```typescript
// Before
const BASE_CURRENCY = 'USD';

// After
const BASE_CURRENCY = 'PKR'; // Base currency for conversions (Pakistani Rupee)
```

Also updated all conversion logic comments to reflect PKR as base:
- Convert through PKR instead of USD
- Base currency references updated

**Files Changed:**
- `src/lib/utils/currencyConversion.ts`

---

## 3. âœ… **Fixed Currency Selector to Auto-Convert Amounts**

### Problem
When changing currency in the form, the amount displayed didn't convert - it just changed the currency label.

### Solution
Implemented **automatic currency conversion** when the currency selector changes.

### How It Works

1. **New State Variables:**
   ```typescript
   const [previousCurrency, setPreviousCurrency] = useState('PKR');
   const [isConverting, setIsConverting] = useState(false);
   ```

2. **Currency Change Handler:**
   ```typescript
   const handleCurrencyChange = async (newCurrency: string) => {
     const currentAmount = parseFloat(formData.amount);
     
     // If there's a valid amount, convert it
     if (!isNaN(currentAmount) && currentAmount > 0 && previousCurrency !== newCurrency) {
       setIsConverting(true);
       try {
         const convertedAmount = await convertCurrency(
           currentAmount,
           previousCurrency as Currency,
           newCurrency as Currency
         );
         setFormData({ ...formData, amount: convertedAmount.toFixed(2) });
       } catch (error) {
         console.error('Currency conversion failed:', error);
         // Don't convert if API fails, just change currency
       } finally {
         setIsConverting(false);
       }
     }
     
     setCurrency(newCurrency);
     setPreviousCurrency(newCurrency);
   };
   ```

3. **Updated UI:**
   - Currency dropdown now uses `handleCurrencyChange` instead of direct `setCurrency`
   - Shows "Converting..." indicator during conversion
   - Added helpful text: "Amount will auto-convert when you change currency"
   - Dropdown is disabled during conversion

### Example Usage

**User enters: 100 PKR**
1. Changes currency to USD
2. Amount automatically converts to ~0.36 USD (based on current rate)
3. User sees live conversion

**User enters: 50 USD**
1. Changes currency to EUR
2. Amount automatically converts to ~46 EUR
3. Conversion happens instantly

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/layout/MainContent.tsx`
  - Added import for `convertCurrency`
  - Added new state variables
  - Created `handleCurrencyChange` function
  - Updated currency selector to use new handler
  - Added conversion UI feedback
