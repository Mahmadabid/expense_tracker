### 10. Complete Responsiveness

- Ensure readable text sizes
- Proper spacing and alignment

### 11. Delete Functionality
- Already implemented in API routes
- Need UI buttons/confirmations for all entities

### 12. Update Old Components
- Migrate old `components/dashboard/` to new structure
- Update imports throughout app
- Remove deprecated files

## File Migration Status

### Created (New Structure):
- ✅ `src/types/` - All type definitions
- ✅ `src/constants/` - All constants
- ✅ `src/utils/` - Encryption and security utilities
- ✅ `src/services/income.service.ts`
- ✅ `src/features/income/useIncome.hook.ts`
- ✅ `src/features/dashboard/Dashboard.tsx`
- ✅ `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`
- ✅ `src/context/ThemeContext.tsx`
- ✅ `src/app/api/income/` - Income API routes
- ✅ Updated `src/app/api/expenses/route.ts` with security
- ✅ Updated `src/app/api/loans/` with payments and security
- ✅ Updated `src/app/globals.css` with new palette
- ✅ Updated `src/app/layout.tsx` with ThemeProvider

### To Update:
- ⏳ `src/lib/apiClient.ts` - Add income methods
- ⏳ Old dashboard components → new feature-based structure
- ⏳ `src/app/page.tsx` - Update imports

### To Remove (After Migration):
- `src/lib/models.ts` (replaced by `src/types/`)
- `src/lib/currencies.ts` (replaced by `src/constants/currency.constants.ts`)
- `src/lib/encryption.ts` (replaced by `src/utils/encryption.util.ts`)
- Old `src/components/dashboard/` files (after creating new ones)

## Next Steps Priority

1. Create dashboard sub-components (forms, cards, history)
2. Update `apiClient.ts` with income and payment methods
3. Update `page.tsx` to use new Dashboard
4. Test all functionality
5. Redesign landing page
6. Final responsiveness testing
7. Clean up old files

## Design Guidelines

- **Buttons**: Small, 2-3rem height, no gradients
- **Cards**: White/dark background, subtle borders
- **Spacing**: Consistent padding/margins
- **Typography**: Clear hierarchy, readable sizes
- **Colors**: Use CSS variables for consistency
- **No Gradients**: Flat, clean aesthetic
- **Borders**: Use `border-border` class (Atmosphere/Graphite)
