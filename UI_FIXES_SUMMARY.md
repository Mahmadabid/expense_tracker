# UI Fixes and Mobile Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Modal/Popup Z-Index Issues
**Problem:** The floating action button (FAB) was displaying over modals, hiding content and making it hard to interact with forms.

**Solution:**
- Changed main modal z-index from `z-50` to `z-[100]`
- Changed payment modal z-index from `z-50` to `z-[100]`
- Changed add loan modal z-index from `z-50` to `z-[100]`
- Reduced FAB button z-index from `z-50` to `z-40`

This ensures all modals appear above the FAB button, preventing overlap issues.

### 2. ✅ Mobile Modal Size Improvements
**Problem:** Popups were too large on mobile devices, covering most of the screen and making it hard to see content.

**Solution:**

#### Modal Height Adjustments:
- **Main transaction/loan modal**: Changed from `max-h-[90vh]` to `max-h-[85vh] sm:max-h-[90vh]`
- **Payment modal**: Changed from `max-h-[90vh]` to `max-h-[70vh] sm:max-h-[85vh]`
- **Add More Loan modal**: Changed from `max-h-[90vh]` to `max-h-[70vh] sm:max-h-[85vh]`

This provides more breathing room on mobile screens (70% height on mobile vs 85-90% on desktop).

#### Spacing Reductions:
- **Form padding**: Changed from `p-4 sm:p-6` to `p-3 sm:p-6`
- **Form spacing**: Changed from `space-y-4 sm:space-y-5` to `space-y-3 sm:space-y-5`
- **Modal content padding**: Changed from `p-5 space-y-5 pb-8` to `p-4 sm:p-5 space-y-3 sm:space-y-5 pb-6 sm:pb-8`
- **Button gap**: Changed from `gap-3` to `gap-2 sm:gap-3`

#### Input Field Adjustments:
- **Amount inputs**: 
  - Padding: `px-4 py-4` → `px-3 sm:px-4 py-3 sm:py-4`
  - Font size: `text-xl` → `text-lg sm:text-xl`
- **Text inputs**:
  - Padding: `px-4 py-3` → `px-3 sm:px-4 py-2.5 sm:py-3`
  - Font size: `text-base` → `text-sm sm:text-base`
- **Date inputs**:
  - Padding: `px-4 py-3` → `px-3 sm:px-4 py-2.5 sm:py-3`
  - Font size: `text-base` → `text-sm sm:text-base`

### 3. ✅ Add More Loan Feature Improvements
**Problem:** The add more loan feature was not updating or displaying correctly.

**Solution:**

#### API Enhancements (`src/app/api/loans/[id]/add-amount/route.ts`):

1. **Better amount calculation logic:**
   ```typescript
   const currentAmount = decrypted.amount || 0;
   const currentOriginalAmount = decrypted.originalAmount || currentAmount;
   const currentRemainingAmount = decrypted.remainingAmount || currentAmount;
   ```
   Now properly falls back to current values instead of potentially using stale data.

2. **Added comprehensive logging:**
   - Logs current amounts before addition
   - Logs the amount being added
   - Logs the new calculated amounts
   - Confirms successful save

3. **Added proper comment _id:**
   - System comments now have MongoDB ObjectId for proper tracking
   - Comments include the amount added and optional description

4. **Improved data freshness:**
   - After saving, fetches the updated loan from database
   - Returns freshly decrypted data to ensure UI gets latest values
   - This ensures the UI displays the correct updated amounts immediately

## Testing Checklist

### Modal Display:
- [ ] Verify modals appear above the FAB button on mobile
- [ ] Confirm modals don't cover entire screen on mobile (70% height)
- [ ] Check that modals are easy to scroll through on small screens
- [ ] Test that clicking outside modal closes it properly

### Add More Loan:
- [ ] Create a loan with an initial amount
- [ ] Use "Add More Loan" to increase the amount
- [ ] Verify the remaining amount increases correctly
- [ ] Check that the loan card displays the new amount
- [ ] Confirm a system comment is created tracking the addition
- [ ] Refresh the page and verify amounts persist correctly

### Mobile Responsiveness:
- [ ] Test on various mobile screen sizes (320px, 375px, 414px wide)
- [ ] Verify all modals are usable without excessive scrolling
- [ ] Check that form inputs are appropriately sized
- [ ] Confirm buttons are easy to tap

## Technical Details

### Z-Index Stack:
- **z-[100]**: All modals (transaction, payment, add loan)
- **z-40**: FAB button
- **z-10**: Modal sticky headers

This ensures proper layering where modals always appear on top.

### Responsive Breakpoints:
- Most adjustments kick in at the `sm:` breakpoint (640px)
- Mobile-first approach with smaller defaults
- Desktop gets larger padding, spacing, and font sizes

### Amount Calculation Fix:
The API now correctly:
1. Decrypts current loan data
2. Extracts current amounts with proper fallbacks
3. Adds new amount to all relevant fields (amount, originalAmount, remainingAmount)
4. Re-encrypts with updated data
5. Saves and returns fresh data

This ensures the UI always displays accurate, up-to-date loan amounts.
