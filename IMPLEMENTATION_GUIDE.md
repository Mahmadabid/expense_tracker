# Expense Tracker - Implementation Guide

This document provides instructions for completing the setup and testing the refactored expense tracker.

## What Has Been Completed

### ✅ Complete Restructuring
- **New Directory Structure**: Organized by features, types, constants, utils, and services
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript types in `src/types/`
- **Constants**: Centralized constants in `src/constants/`
- **Utilities**: Security and encryption utilities in `src/utils/`

### ✅ Security Enhancements
- **Enhanced Encryption**: Numbers, strings, and objects can all be encrypted
- **NoSQL Injection Protection**: Input sanitization across all API routes
- **Validation**: Comprehensive input validation for all operations

### ✅ New Features
1. **Income Tracking**: Full CRUD operations for income with categories
2. **Net Worth Calculation**: Automatically calculated from income, expenses, and loans
3. **Loan Payments**: Support for partial loan payments with history
4. **Delete Functionality**: Delete operations for all entities

### ✅ UI Redesign
- **Dark Mode**: Tailwind v4 dark mode with Stark & Luminous color palette
- **Header Component**: Standalone header with theme toggle
- **Dashboard**: Completely redesigned with tabs, forms, and history
- **No Gradients**: Clean, flat design as requested
- **Smaller Buttons**: Compact, modern button design
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first responsive design

## Testing Your Application

### 1. Install Dependencies (if needed)
```powershell
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables
Ensure your `.env.local` file contains:
```
DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<your-32-byte-base64-key>
MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-connection-string>
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=<your-firebase-api-key>
# ... other Firebase config
```

### 3. Run Development Server
```powershell
npm run dev
```

### 4. Test Features

#### Test Dark Mode
- Click the sun/moon icon in the header to toggle dark mode
- Theme preference is saved to localStorage

#### Test Income Tracking
1. Click "+ Income" tab
2. Add income (e.g., Salary, $5000)
3. Check the Net Worth card updates

#### Test Expenses
1. Click "+ Expense" tab
2. Add expense (e.g., Food, $50)
3. Check summary cards update

#### Test Loans
1. Click "+ Loan" tab
2. Create a loan as lender or borrower
3. Add loan payment via history (future enhancement)

#### Test Net Worth
- Net Worth = Total Income - Total Expenses + Loans Lent - Loans Borrowed
- Should update automatically when you add transactions

#### Test Transaction History
1. Click "History" tab
2. Filter by type (All, Expenses, Income, Loans)
3. Delete transactions using the delete button
4. Settle loans using the settle button

## Known Issues & Notes

### CSS Linting Warnings
The `@custom-variant` and `@theme` at-rules in `globals.css` are part of Tailwind v4 syntax. These linting warnings can be safely ignored - they work at runtime.

### TypeScript Module Resolution
If you see TypeScript errors about module resolution, try:
```powershell
# Delete node_modules and reinstall
rm -r node_modules
npm install

# Or restart your TypeScript server in VS Code
# Command Palette -> "TypeScript: Restart TS Server"
```

## Remaining Enhancements (Optional)

### 1. Landing Page Redesign
The main landing page (when not authenticated) could be redesigned with:
- Hero section with the new color palette
- Feature highlights
- Clean, modern layout without gradients

### 2. Loan Payment UI
Currently, loan payments are added via the API. You could add:
- A "Make Payment" button in the transaction history
- A modal/form to enter payment amount and note
- Display payment history for each loan

### 3. Charts/Visualizations
Add charts to visualize:
- Expense breakdown by category
- Income vs Expenses over time
- Net worth trend

### 4. Export Functionality
Allow users to export their financial data to CSV/PDF

## Color Palette Reference

### Light Mode
- **Background**: Lunar White `#F5F7FA`
- **Text**: Graphite `#2D3748`
- **Borders**: Atmosphere `#E2E8F0`
- **Accent**: Holo-Blue `#00A1FF`

### Dark Mode
- **Background**: `#1A202C`
- **Text**: Lunar White `#F5F7FA`
- **Borders**: Graphite `#2D3748`
- **Accent**: Holo-Blue `#00A1FF`

### CSS Variables Usage
```css
background: var(--background);
color: var(--foreground);
border-color: var(--border);
background-color: var(--accent);
```

### Tailwind Classes
```tsx
className="bg-background text-foreground border-border"
className="bg-accent text-white" // For buttons
className="dark:bg-graphite" // Dark mode specific
```

## File Organization

### New Structure
```

├── types/              # TypeScript type definitions
│   ├── expense.types.ts
│   ├── income.types.ts
│   ├── loan.types.ts

```

### Files You Can Remove (After Testing)
Once everything works, you can safely remove:
- `src/lib/models.ts` (replaced by `src/types/`)
- `src/lib/currencies.ts` (replaced by `src/constants/`)
- `src/lib/encryption.ts` (replaced by `src/utils/`)
- `src/components/dashboard/Dashboard.tsx` (old version)
- `src/components/dashboard/SummaryCards.tsx` (old version)

## API Endpoints

### Expenses
- `GET /api/expenses?userId={userId}` - Get all expenses
- `POST /api/expenses` - Create expense
- `DELETE /api/expenses/[id]` - Delete expense

### Income
- `GET /api/income?userId={userId}` - Get all income
- `POST /api/income` - Create income
- `DELETE /api/income/[id]` - Delete income

### Loans
- `GET /api/loans?userId={userId}` - Get all loans
- `POST /api/loans` - Create loan
- `PATCH /api/loans/[id]` - Update loan (settle or add payment)
- `DELETE /api/loans/[id]` - Delete loan

### Adding a Loan Payment
```typescript
// PATCH /api/loans/[id]
{
  "payment": {
    "amount": 100,
    "note": "First installment"
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Theme Not Working
1. Check that `ThemeProvider` wraps your app in `layout.tsx`
2. Ensure `suppressHydrationWarning` is on the `<html>` tag
3. Clear browser cache and localStorage

### Encryption Errors
1. Verify `DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is set in environment variables
2. Key should be 32 bytes (256 bits)
3. Generate a new key: `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64'))"`

### API Authentication Errors
1. Ensure Firebase is properly configured
2. Check that user is authenticated before API calls
3. Verify JWT token is included in Authorization header

## Next Steps

1. **Test Thoroughly**: Test all features in both light and dark modes
2. **Mobile Testing**: Test on mobile devices for responsiveness
3. **Browser Testing**: Test on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
4. **Performance**: Check loading times and optimize if needed
5. **Security**: Review all API endpoints for proper authentication and validation
6. **Documentation**: Update README.md with new features and usage

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Review Network tab for API call failures  
3. Verify environment variables are correctly set
4. Ensure MongoDB connection is working
5. Check Firebase authentication is configured

- [ ] Environment variables configured on hosting platform
- [ ] Database migrations run (if any)
- [ ] Build succeeds without errors: `npm run build`
- [ ] All features tested in production build
